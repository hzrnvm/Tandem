      <h2>Where is Tandem</h2>
      <h3>The ocean? What?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Water Ocean</li>
        <li>that touches a coast</li>
        <li>Ocean that is <em>deep</em></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Yeah, but I'm dumb and I still don't get it</h3>
      <p>Get out your lovely map. Check greenland. How big is it? <br><br>It's Bigger than South America <br>It's Smaller than South America <br><br>If it's smaller than South America, welcome into the explanation! If not, you will never be allowed into Tandem because you aren't even cool enough to know not to use the Mercator projection. Basically, look at the ocean. It's there. It's in there. (have you ever thought about how an island is a planet in a 2D ocean space?)</p>
